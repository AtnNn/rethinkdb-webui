                            <p>I saw for the first time the earth's shape. I
                            could easily see the shores of continents, islands,
                            great rivers, folds of the terrain, large bodies of
                            water. The horizon is dark blue, smoothly turning
                            to black. . . the feelings which filled me I can
                            express with one wordâ€”joy.</p>

                            <p>The vehicle explodes, literally explodes, off
                            the pad. The simulator shakes you a little bit, but
                            the actual liftoff shakes your entire body and
                            soul.</p>

                            <p>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance,
                            the delusion that we have some privileged position
                            in the Universe, are challenged by this point of
                            pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the
                            great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in
                            all this vastness, there is no hint that help will
                            come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</p>

                            <p>The Earth is the only world known so far to
                            harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the
                            near future, to which our species could migrate.
                            Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for
                            the moment the Earth is where we make our
                            stand.</p>

                            <p>The surface is fine and powdery. I can kick it
                            up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine
                            layers, like powdered charcoal, to the sole and
                            sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of
                            an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see
                            the footprints of my boots and the treads in the
                            fine, sandy particles. There seems to be no
                            difficult in moving around, as we suspected.</p>
